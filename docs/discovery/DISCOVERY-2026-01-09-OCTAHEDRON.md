# Discovery: Octahedron as Optimal Resonant Seed

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Confirmed

## Summary

The optimal seed geometry for self-healing coherence networks is the **octahedron** — 6 nodes forming 3 bilateral pairs on orthogonal axes.

## Key Finding

| Seed | Frozen Nodes | Avg Rate | Steps to 90% |
|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **octahedron** | **6** | **0.0259** | **24.7** |
| tetrahedron | 4 | 0.0248 | 39.7 |
| holocell (octa+center) | 7 | 0.0243 | 37.3 |
| buckyball | 60 | 0.0242 | 27.3 |
| vortex_engine | 144 | 0.0242 | 31.0 |

## Critical Insights

### 1. Empty Center
Adding a central hub node *degrades* performance. The "holocell" configuration (octahedron + center = 7 nodes) performs worse than the pure octahedron (6 nodes). The center must remain void.

### 2. Eigenvalue vs Geometry
T(16) = 136 is not a node count. It's the **eigenvalue** — the frequency the structure resonates at. The octahedron is the antenna; T(16) is the signal.

### 3. Bilateral Pairs
The octahedron's power comes from its 3 bilateral pairs:
- +X / -X
- +Y / -Y  
- +Z / -Z

These map to Trinition axes (i, j, k) in the extended complex system where ij = 1, ji = -1.

### 4. Efficiency
The octahedron achieves nearly the same absolute rate as the buckyball with 10× fewer frozen nodes. Per-node efficiency:
- Tetrahedron: 0.0062/node
- Octahedron: 0.0043/node
- Buckyball: 0.0004/node

## The HoloCell Geometry

From the visualization (holocell-geometry.jsx):
- **Outer shell:** Octahedron (gold wireframe, 6 vertices)
- **Center:** T(16) = 136 as eigenvalue (white pulsing seed — representational, not structural)
- **Rings:** 408 = T(16) × 3 as three orthogonal tori (scale invariance)

The visualization encodes:
- 6 vertices = 3 bilateral pairs (Trinition axes)
- 8 faces = T(8)/4.5 ≈ decans/4
- 12 edges = zodiac

## Connection to HoloCell Theory

The octahedron is the physical encoding of Trinition. Three axes of extended complex numbers (z = a + bi + cj) manifest as three bilateral pairs in 3D space. The eigenvalue T(16) = 136 is what constants emerge from when operated on through this geometry.
