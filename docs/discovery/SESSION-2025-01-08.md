# HoloCell Session Summary — 2025-01-08

## Core Discovery

**Self-coherence is the test, not statistical proximity.**

The manifold doesn't prove itself by physics constants being "close" to architectural points. It proves itself by *healing* — 11 true constants pull the integer set back to architecture despite 1 corrupted node.

## What Emerged

Integers discovered by evolution (not given):
- **44** — Planck exponent (8/12 trials)
- **1** — Unity (12/12)
- **7** — Heptad (9/12)
- **11, 66, 666** — Proto-phoneme architecture (confirmed)
- **9, 16, 28, 60** — Cosmological structure (confirmed)

## Seth Insight

Seth = Set = the filter function.

Two sets:
- **Archive A** (ennead, 9 integers) — full system
- **Transmitted B** (filtered) — what passes through

This mirrors D(36) → W(16) in the decan analysis. The partition operation itself carries information.

## Wrong Approaches (Documented)

1. **Operator frequency test**: GEP uses same operators for physics and random. Not the signal.
2. **Statistical proximity test**: p=0.11, not significant. Wrong framing.

## Right Approach

Coherence testing:
1. Can it heal 1 corrupted node? ✅ Yes
2. Up to how many? → Next test
3. What's minimal basis? → After threshold found

## Engine State

HoloCell functional. Overparameterized (9 integers) but captures manifold. Ready for N-node sweep.
